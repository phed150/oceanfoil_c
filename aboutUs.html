						<span class="noir">Captain Roger Francis</span><br /><span class="lblue">Marine Consultant</span>
								<p>Captain Francis is a retired deep sea pilot, having trained at Trinity House, prior to which
									he captained numerous merchant vessels for Stephenson Clarke Shipping and served as a
									Chief Officer on ships of the Geest Line and Harrisons. In 1987, Captain Francis was selected
									as the Master of the merchant vessel M.V. Ashington during sea trials of the ‘Walker Wingsail’
									aerofoil design, completing several voyages with the system in place in the course of its
									evaluation. Oceanfoil now controls the rights to the aerofoil designed by John Walker and
									this forms the basis for Oceanfoil’s improved designs.</p>
								<p>Roger Francis possesses a Master’s Foreign Going certificate and Deep Sea Pilotage

								<p>Robert Vincent is a technical designer, specialising in the computer aided design and drafting
									of marine technologies and naval architecture. Robert Vincent has extensive experience
									in the design and modelling of aerofoil technology for the marine sector as well as smaller
									vessels powered solely by the technology. He has been closely involved in the progressive
									refinement of aerofoil designs throughout a career spanning thirty years.</p>
								<p>Making use of computational modelling techniques, and adapting the designs to modern,
									composite materials and production processes, Robert is instrumental to fully realising the
									value of this technology to the transport fleet.</p>
